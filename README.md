## Audio Sequencer
- https://creative-exercise-rodrigomarce.glitch.me
- I chose to work on Web Audio API
- I used the sequencer and button components from the [NexusUI API](https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/api/#intro) and used the [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) web audio framework to get some sound.
- I first assigned a number to every note (from C3 to C4), each corresponding to a row in the sequencer. I modified the sequencer size to adapt to this. I also created a counter to track where (which column) the user is in the sequencer. Then, I wrote some code so that clicking on the sequencer would produce a sound corresponding to the row. The highest row plays C3 and the lowest plays C4. I also modified the code so that when clicking on the big button at the bottom, the sequencer would take a step and play any notes that were registered on that step.
- To use the program, first fill in the sequencer and then click on the big button to step by the columns one by one. There are 13 rows, each one representing a note from C3 to C4 ascending by half steps. The program can only play one note at a time, so filling in more than one square in the same column will result in the program only playing the highest note (pitch).
